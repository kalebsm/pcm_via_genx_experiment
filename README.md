## [Check out the website for instructions](https://immm-sfa.github.io/metarepo)
`metarepo` is short for meta-repository, a GitHub repository that contains instructions to reproduce results in a published work. This repo is a template for creating your own metarepo.

## Purpose
A meta-repository creates a single point of access for someone to find all of the components that were used to create a published work for the purpose of reproducibility. This repository should contain references to all minted data and software as well as any ancillary code used to transform the source data, create figures for your publication, conduct the experiment, and / or execute the contributing software.

## Abstract

## Journal reference

## Code reference
References for each minted software release for all code involved.  

These are generated by Zenodo automatically when conducting a release when Zenodo has been linked to your GitHub repository. The Zenodo references are built by setting the author order in order of contribution to the code using the author's GitHub username.  This citation can, and likely should, be edited without altering the DOI.

If you have modified a codebase that is outside of a formal release, and the modifications are not planned on being merged back into a version, fork the parent repository and add a `.<shortname>` to the version number of the parent and construct your own name.  For example, `v1.2.5.hydro`.

## Program requirements
Running the scripts and computations will require the installation of the following:
1. A python version 3.10 or higher
2. A julia version 1.11 or higher
3. Gurobi license 9.4 or higher

Additionally, these experiments were originally run on an Intel i7-10700K CPU, 3.7 Ghz machine with 8 GB RAM. The total time for all 11 cases of the experiment to run on that machine was approximately 33 hours, or 3 hours per experiment (without parallelization).

## Reproduce my experiment
1. open a git bash terminal in the desired folder and enter: `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/kalebsm/spcm_genx_experiment.git`
2. download the following ERCOT data from NREL ARPA-E PERFORM dataset and save in `spcm_genx_experiment\SPCM\src\scenario_generation\sequential_norta\data`
