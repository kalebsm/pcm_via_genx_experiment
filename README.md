# Abstract
This paper considers the impact of operational uncertainty on spot price distributions and resource valuation in power markets as systems transition to high levels of wind, solar, and storage resources. In systems dominated by thermal resources with minimal storage, marginal costs and therefore market clearing prices are driven by fuel costs, enabling modelers to rely on simplified deterministic formulations to approximate price behavior. Future price formation may instead be increasingly driven by storage opportunity costs, necessitating a more sophisticated representation of uncertainty and intertemporal constraints. In this paper we describe the mechanics of price formation with storage, employ a stochastic production cost model to simulate prices in modeled future systems, and highlight the differences between the simulated revenues and those that arise in deterministic simplifications. We perform numerical tests using a plausible representation of short-term forecast uncertainty and assess the economic impact of this uncertainty across cases with different battery durations and quantities.

## Program requirements
Running the scripts and computations will require the installation of the following:
1. A python version 3.10 or higher
2. A julia version 1.11 or higher
3. Gurobi license 9.4 or higher

Additionally, these experiments were originally run on an Intel i7-10700K CPU, 3.7 Ghz machine with 8 GB RAM. The total time for all 11 cases of the experiment to run on that machine was approximately 33 hours, or 3 hours per experiment (without parallelization).

## Reproduce my experiment
1. open a git bash terminal in the desired folder and enter: `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/kalebsm/pcm_via_genx_experiment.git`
2. download the following ERCOT data from NREL ARPA-E PERFORM dataset and save in `spcm_genx_experiment\SPCM\src\scenario_generation\sequential_norta\data`
