# Example Jupyter notebooks
The notebooks in this directory show several ways to interact with the ATB data and processing
pipeline. Note that command line interface tools also exist to run the pipeline.

## Installing and starting the Jupyter server
Jupyter can be installed with:

```
$ pip install jupyter
```

The Jupyter server can then be started by running:

```
$ jupyter-notebook
```

The examples also require matplotlib which can be installed with 
```
$ pip install matplotlib
```

## Notebooks
* `Full work flow.ipynb` Run the ATB pipeline for multiple technologies and extract the data.
* `Process ATB electricity technology.ipynb` Run the ATB pipeline for an individual technology.
